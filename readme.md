# Ping the Patreo team

This repository serves as our open inbox. [Ask us anything](../../issues/new).

### Get in touch

Getting in touch is as easy as [creating a new issue](../../issues/new).

We'll try to respond as soon as we can. Once we've answered, we'll close the issue just so we know what we've covered it, but don't worry -- if you have any further questions just respond in the thread and we'll get back to you soon. Feel free to comment on older issues too, even if you didn't create it.

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite :)

### Browse previous conversations

[Check out the closed issues filter](../../issues?sort=created&direction√ûsc&state=closed&page=1) to browse previous conversations we've had. We try to use this as an email replacement everyone can see, so feel free to dig into some of the older threads.

### Twitter
